## Workers + Turso

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) using [ChiselStrike's Turso](https://chiselstrike.com/) as a database.

> **Note**: The "libsql-client" library is patched to work without SQLite and to support HTTP Basic Authentication to the Turso API.

Not production code; not tested; unlikely to be idiomatic. Probably has bugs 🐞!
